The Web Console — WC for short — is an additional tool for remote control of Routr server that ships with the Command-Line tool. The Web Console connects with your Routr server remotely using a Restful API.

# Getting Started

The WC ships with the Command-Line tool. You do not need to install it separately. To launch the WC, first, make sure you have a working Routr server. You are also going to have to [install the Command-Line tool](https://routr.io/docs/administration/cli/installation/). With the Command-Line tool installed launch the WC by running the following command:

```bash
rctl proxy
```

> The WC re-uses the credentials of your Command-Line Tool
